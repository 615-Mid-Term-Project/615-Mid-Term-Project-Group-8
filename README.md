# Bee Toxin Level Analysis of Strawberry Data

-- The purpose of this assignment was to clean and analyze the USDA Strawberry chemical data, as well as hone our skills in creating R code generated reports, presentations, and Shiny apps.

-- Our initial EDA process had us cleaning out and understanding the messy datasets of Strawberries.csv and Pesticides(1).csv. From this, we were able to glean how the confusing measurement structure was set up, and turned our focus towards focusing on Bee Toxin levels in the strawberry chemicals

-- Once we had a greater sense of what the dataset held, we focused in on the Bee Safe Program in California. The latter part of our EDA was focused on ascertaining the effectiveness of this program

-- Our final report can be found in Final_Report.pdf. The presentation used in MA 615 can be built using Group8_Presentation.Rmd. The Shiny app to help visualize our data can be found within the shiny folder.
